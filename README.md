forked from AlexGyver/GyverRGB (https://github.com/AlexGyver/GyverRGB)

Rewrite firmware to work with DIN-led stripes instead of R-G-B-V-led stripes.

## Scheme
![SCHEME](https://github.com/netkot/RGB-Led-lamp/blob/master/schemes/scheme1.png)

Note: Current over Arduino is less than 160mA (white, 100% bright), so i can skip led driver.
